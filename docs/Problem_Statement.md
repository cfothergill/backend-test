# Problem Statement

The web app client requires user to persist single events
and then to aggregate all events into a summary on fetch.

The solution must be written in Node.js, fully tested and
runnable on the AWS ecosystem (instructions must be clear for running and testing)

Your assumptions must be stated.

A little elaboration of the terminology we use to garner a bit more context:

- Session - refers to a learning session made up of modules that display content.
- Modules - display content to the user. There are 15 module types and these are used depending on the type of content that is being displayed e.g. the toggles module you did in the front end task!
